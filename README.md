# Nails Segmentation machine learning

The project demonstrates the use of computer vision algorithms to highlight nail areas in images using a ready-made dataset with Roboflow.

## Project Description

The following steps are presented in the notebook:
- **Image Preprocessing:** preparation of data for subsequent processing.
- **Segmentation and recognition:** the use of algorithms (traditional or based on deep learning) to highlight nails in images.
- **Visualization of results:** Display of source images and segmentation results for visual comparison.

This project can serve as a starting point for research in the field of medical diagnostics, the aesthetic industry or other applications where automatic recognition and segmentation of nails is required.

## Requirements

To work with the project, it is recommended to use:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Roboflow datasets

The main libraries that may be needed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- opencv-python
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow/keras or pytorch (depending on the chosen approach)

If there is a file `requirements.txt ` install the dependencies with the command:
``bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Installation and launch

Clone the repository:
``bash
git clone https://github.com/Kologeter/nails_segmentation.git
```
Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd nails_segmentation
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

It is recommended to use graphics cards with a large number of CUDA cores.
